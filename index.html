            <h1>Haewon Rachel Jin</h1>
                <p>My name is Rachel and I am a UX/UI Designer.</p>
                <p>I entered into the world of UX because of its unique interaction of people, design, and technology. As a person who is constantly intrigued by how many people perceive one product differently, I am determined to find the right balance of what grabs the users' interest.</p>
                <p>As an intuitive and prospecting individual, I am flexible to all possibilities while remaining logical. I have quickly learned that working in groups is crucial for UX development, and my past professional experience demonstrates myself as a collaborative team player.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I am knee-deep in fashion, cinematography, and cafe hopping. Chat with me on the latest athleisure wear or let's dive into the meaning behind Inception's ending scene over some coffee!</p>
